#  MauiTecmicProject

This repository contains the **MauiTecmicProject**, a simple form-based application developed with .NET MAUI. The project also includes a structure prepared for automated testing with Appium, ready for future integration into CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps.

## Project Context

This project was developed as part of a **real company project**. The goal was to explore the use of a **new automated testing tool**, evaluating its integration with .NET MAUI applications and the potential for automating tests in continuous integration environments.


---

## ðŸ§ª Automated Tests

- Tests are written with **Appium** for Android.  
- The goal is to validate the appâ€™s behavior on mobile devices or emulators.  
- Tests are located in the `/Tests` file.  
- The project is **not yet integrated into a cloud testing service**, so tests are executed locally with Android emulators or real devices.

## ðŸ”§Technologies Used

- [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)  
- [MAUI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/)
